# Euroleague Wiki
A 2024-25 term project by the group Cyclones for the BLG317E Database Systems course given in ITU.

The project aims to offer a website where people can find valuable information regarding the history of Euroleague, including all of the teams, matches and the details of every point scored in those matches to name a few. Ranging from the 2007-08 season to 2024-25, the website contains Euroleague data of the last 17 years by utilizing a public dataset.

The public dataset that will be partially used for the project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/babissamothrakis/euroleague-datasets
